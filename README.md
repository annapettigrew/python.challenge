PYBANK
In this code PyBank, the objective was to scan a series of months of profits and losses to gather the following data:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

As observed, the total number of months in the data set was 86, total profits came out to $22,564,198.


PYPOLL
In this code PyPoll, the objective was to scan a series of ballots and votes in an election to gather the following data:

The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

As observed, the total number of votes, along with the canidates (how many votes they recieved and what percentage of votes they recieved). Also outputed a winner of the election. 


In both of these codes I used a series of .append, for, and if statements to loop through the data to gather and interpret the results.
